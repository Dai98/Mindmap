# Mindmap

I am a keen user of Mindmap, because it is a simple method that keeps knowledge structured yet brief.

### Dependencies

This repository uses the `vscode-mindmap` extension in VSCode to edit and export mindmaps. The `.km` files are the source files of the mindmaps. The `codes` folder contains implementations of data structures and algorithms with Java 11.
